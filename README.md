# Clustering-for-Targeted-Marketing
The primary goal of this project is to revolutionize targeted marketing campaigns for stores by leveraging data from Kaggle's Customer Personality Analysis dataset. Through the implementation of Cluster Analysis, Hierarchical Dendrograms, and K-means Clustering models, customers are systematically grouped, enhancing the precision of marketing strategies. Notably, the exclusion of the 'Recency' variable streamlines the dataset, resulting in uniformly distributed customer groups across income ranges. This project's versatility extends beyond retail to supermarkets, corporates, and organizations seeking to optimize their targeted marketing practices. The clustering algorithm employed facilitates the identification of groups with closer average distances between members, offering a data-driven approach to personalize marketing efforts.
