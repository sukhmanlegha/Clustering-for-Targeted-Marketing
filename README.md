# Clustering-for-Targeted-Marketing
This project focuses on enhancing targeted marketing strategies through customer segmentation using data obtained from Kaggle. Leveraging Cluster Analysis, Hierarchical Dendrograms, and K-means Clustering models, the objective is to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their spending patterns, channel preferences, and responsiveness to discounts. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's 'marketing_data.csv', includes various customer-related columns such as recency, spending on different products, and purchase channels. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and dimension reduction were performed to streamline and standardize the dataset.

The analysis begins with hierarchical clustering, where a distance matrix is computed, normalized, and visualized through dendrograms. Five clusters are identified based on the distance matrix, and cluster characteristics are analyzed. K-means clustering is then applied with six clusters, exploring cluster centroids and profile plots. An elbow chart is employed to determine the optimal cluster count. The project concludes with specific recommendations for targeted marketing based on the characteristics of each cluster.

In summary, this project offers a comprehensive approach to customer segmentation for targeted marketing. By identifying distinct customer groups and understanding their preferences, supermarkets and organizations can tailor marketing strategies more effectively. The recommendations provide actionable insights for addressing the diverse needs and behaviors of different customer segments, optimizing resource allocation and improving overall marketing efficiency.
